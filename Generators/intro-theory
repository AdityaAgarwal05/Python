Generator fns allows us to write a fn that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off.


Generators allows to generate a sequence of values over time instead of having to create the entire seuence as a whole and holding the memory.


the main difference in the sequence is the use of yield keyword.


when a generator fn is compilled that becomes an object that supports an itertion protocol.


that means when they are callled in your code they don't return a value and then exit.


generator fns will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation.


the advantage is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front, the generator generates one value waits untill the next value is called for

let say you want to have the values from 1 to million, so instead of producing the giant list fom 1 to million in the memory, you can use generator, this is how range() also works

if user needs the list they have to transform the generator into the list, like this-
  list(range(1,100))
