oops allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes

as we were using .method_name() syntax for lists and strings

for much larger scripts of python functions themselves are not suffiecient for organisation and repeatability
commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with to create code that is more usable

objects here means classes

fn inside class are called methods





__init__  is a method in class/object which is like a constructor which allows to craete an instance of the object

note:- everything in python is an object
we can use class to create user defined objects


class is like a blueprint which defines the nature of future object

instance is an specific object created from a particular class


class Sample():
pass
